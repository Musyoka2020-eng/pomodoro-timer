# Pomodoro Timer

## Overview

The Pomodoro Timer is a simple web application designed to help users manage their time effectively using the Pomodoro Technique. The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

This project includes an HTML file for the structure, a CSS file for styling, and a JavaScript file to implement the timer functionality.

## Features

- Set a timer for 25 minutes, known as a Pomodoro session.
- Start, stop, and reset the timer as needed.
- Receive an alert when the timer reaches zero to notify the end of a Pomodoro session.
- User-friendly interface with visually appealing styling.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Musyoka2020-eng/pomodoro-timer.git
   ```

2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

3. Use the "Start," "Pause," and "Reset" buttons to control the timer.
